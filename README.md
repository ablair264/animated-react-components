# Animated React Components

Expert guidance for analyzing React components and implementing premium, production-grade animations using Motion, React Bits, Aceternity UI, and Magic UI.

## What this skill does
- Evaluates existing UI for high-impact motion opportunities
- Commits to a single aesthetic direction and applies it consistently
- Selects the right component library for the job
- Ensures accessibility and performance best practices

## Production quality
- Uses shared motion tokens for consistent timing and easing
- Enforces reduced-motion fallbacks and keyboard-safe interactions
- Prioritizes transform/opacity and in-view gating for performance
- Includes QA checks for reduced motion, layout stability, and smoothness

## When to use
- You want to enhance an existing React UI with motion
- You need recommendations from React Bits, Aceternity UI, Magic UI, or Motion
- You want a cohesive animation direction with production-quality implementation

## What's included
- `SKILL.md`: Core workflow and decision guidance
- `references/`: Component catalogs, Motion patterns, and checklists
